## What is a valid DNI?

[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documento_Nacional_de_Identidad_%28Spain%29)

The number of the National Identity Document includes 8 digits and one letter for security. The letter is found by taking all 8 digits as a number and dividing it by 23. The remainder of this digit, which is between 0 and 22, gives the letter used for security. The letters I, Ñ, O, U are not used. The letters I and O are not used – to avoid confusions with the numbers 0 and 1. The Ñ is not used in order to avoid confusions with N.

From the beginning up to the present day, DNI's are assigned to the different police stations. Thus, every police station that issues DNI's don't run out of numbers. If the station runs outs of numbers they are assigned a new lot, which is not necessarily the same as the previous lot. This stops the false belief that low new DNI numbers are actually old DNI numbers of someone who has died.

Number one was given to Francisco Franco, with number two being given to his wife, Carmen Polo, and number three to their daughter, Carmen Franco y Polo. The numbers four through nine are vacant to this day. The numbers 10-99 are reserved for the royal family. Number 10 was given to King Juan Carlos I, number 11 for Queen Sofía of Spain and numbers 12 and 14 for Princesses Elena and Christina, respectively. King Felipe VI of Spain has the number 15, Princess Leonor has the number 16 and Princess Infanta Sofía of Spain has the number 17. The number 13 was left out due to superstition.

There is evidence that there are thousands of people that share their DNI numbers.
